  user, and all the comments on those posts:

  (select-tree (user (post (comment ()))))

  This would return a list of output nodes. Each output node is a list where the
  first element contains an entity instance, and the 2nd element is a list of
  child nodes. An example output for the above input would be:

  ((<user object>
    ((<post object>

  ;; don't clash.
